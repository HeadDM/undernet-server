After finding a contact with criminal connections, I was able to make my way here, (almost had 5 migranes along the way, shoutout to Undernet 3), but we made it. And this place is well worth the wait! Super spooky area, with lots of little hidden paths and roadblocks, including rumors of something known as AbyssNet? Sounds spooky. All I know is that these guys aren't to be messed with. So watch your back, be sure to use the UnderMetro, or Jack Out if things are too much for you, and stay safe. Have fun exploring internet Detroit everyone!  -JesterMan.exe","author":"JesterM","time":1750388309},{"id":"4","title":"Where in the..","body":"I think I hopped on the wrong line at Central Station.
